What is Ozone Sauna Therapy?
An Ozone Sauna Therapy treatment, sometimes referred to as an “Activated Oxygen” treatment, is one of the most effective methods of detoxifying and oxygenating the body.  Ozone has been in use since the early 1900’s, and it is used around the world in countries like Germany, Italy, and Russia.  
An “Activated Oxygen” session is one of the most powerful methods of detoxifying and oxygenating the body in existence.  Due to the moist heat in the steam sauna, the pores are opened, and the capillaries are dilated to allow for maximum ozone absorption.  The ozone enters the body and oxidizes all toxins in the fat, the lymph system, and the blood.  Since the majority of toxins are held in the lymphatic system and the fat, this is the most effective way to eliminate them from the body.
